<H1>The Bagder is on our tail</H1>
<p>"Do you want Pemulwuy dead! Do you want to revive our great legend Captain James Cook? Do you because the Windsor members are getting abhorrent!!!" screamed Captain Arthur Phillip.</p>
<p>Patrick Quill didn't feel too good about competing in this war. He felt green to the death. Was Quill even forced to join the fight? Quill eventually joined the Terra Nullius war. Phillip noted that if he destroyed Pemulwuy, Quill would earn two litters of whiskey. Quill dreamed about all the earnings, but he might have to sacrifice his life to win the Pemulwuy war. </p>
<br>
<p>The next day, Quill woke up tired, got his regular cigarette and guzzled up some West England Wine. Though Quill favoured whiskey, it was too expensive. Later that day, Quill left his house and strolled his way to the local butcher shop.</p>
<p>"Hello, my mighty Quill," vocalised the shop's Owner. The man originated from Ireland but later moved to West England. The Owner of the butcher was talking about some random cheese, and Quill was utterly bored while the Owner was randomly talking about cheese. Finally, Quill could buy the cheese, but the Owner was eager to talk more about it. Quill bolted his way out of the store and ramped to Phillip's house.</p>
<p>"Welcome, welcome, Quill," echoed Phillip with his rusty voice.</p>
<p>Quill couldn't believe the glimpse that he was looking. There was a bold chandelier with candles and some palace arch steps. Quill was purely amazed by the Castle. Philip told Quill about Windsor Castle. He also told Quill about George II's harsh orders. Phillip felt like three hundred needles in his body just due to the strict orders by Windsor royal members. Phillip was crucially astonished about the cheese that Quill kindly brought for him. Phillip told Quill about the dates for the war.</p>
<p>"We're leaving in April, okay," told Phillip.</p>
<br>
<p>Two months later...</p>
<br>
<p>It's April 23rd 1802 and the season is summer. The weather wasn't the most smoking as Patrick thought. Quill saw a teenage boy that was wearing a waistcoat and pantaloons. Quill was wondering about him wearing clothes like that for war. Men were swearing at the boy just because of wearing terrible outfit choices. In the meantime, the boats finally arrived. Quill then got on the barque, and the ship was rollin'…</p>
<br>
<p>"GET IN MY OFFICE NOW, QUILL," screamed Phillip. Quill felt green due to his wailing. Quill ramped his way to Phillip's office. He then opened the door and saw that identical boy by the ship with unnecessary clothes. It turned out that the boy called "Harry Roberts" was forced as Quill's partner for the Terra Nullius mission. Roberts was about to go to another country as a migrant only due to the English's poor laws, but he somehow landed on the wrong ship.</p>
<p>40 days later…</p>
<br>
<p>The ships finally arrived at Terra Nullius. Quill and Roberts bolted to the forest. He couldn't find the badger, but they were on the move. Roberts quickly found Pemulwuy hiding behind a bush, and Roberts fired his gun at Pemulwuy. Quill lately threw an arrow that he found on the grass at Pemulwuy.</p>
<p>“SSSSSSSSSS” *Clutch.*</p>
<p>Pemulwuy, the rainbow warrior, was dead but…</p>
<p>“SSSSSSSSSS” *Clutch.*</p>
<br>
<p>"Quill, QUILL!!!" echoed Roberts. A blackfella was right behind Patrick, so he threw an arrow at Quill, which grievously made him paralysed to death. Patrick fell to the ground, looking at Roberts's green eyes and remarked his last words before his death.</p>
<p>"Godspeed, Harry Roberts… the warrior."</p>
<p>"NOOOOOOO," screamed Roberts.</p>
<p>The seventeen-year-old boy couldn't believe what had just happened. Roberts was heartfelt about the death of Quill. The boy told the blackfellas that he was sorry about Pemulwuy. The blackfellas forgive Roberts and let him stay in the land that was known as "Terra Australis." Roberts had to look forward but not backwards at his life but still remember his greatest warrior, Patrick Adam Quill. Harry cut Pemulwuy's head apart from his as a memory of the journey: The Badger is on our Tail.
